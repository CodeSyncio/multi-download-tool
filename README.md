#This tool allows you to:

!quickly open links to download programs
!customize all the links yourself with an easy and straightforward method
!open the links with your default set browser
!automatically kills the browser process to make it easy to download each time



#unctions already implemented:

*customizable links (most of them)
*checks default browser (more easy to use)
*kills processes after each download (less load on RAM)
*minimized the code to make it more lightweigt
*console commands supported for multiple OS'es (full support for win based OS'es or linux distro's)



#functions i still have to do:

!make it even more lightweight
!better con clearing
!make time intervals shorter (not so important)
