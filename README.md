# Multi download tool

### this tool is a fully ( and easy ) customizeable quick installer.

## how to install:
download one of the releases if u want to use an `.exe` version if u dont want to run it with python, or the target computer does'nt have python.<br />
OR just clone the repository to get the source code

## how to use:
open the downloaded `.exe ` or the `.py ` file called `main`. 
## how to configure:
open the config u want to edit <br />(`config_<modulename>`)<br />

a config will look like this:<br />

link<br />
link<br />
link<br />
link<br />
link<br />
link<br />
link<br />
link<br />
link<br />
link<br />
#end of finder/start of info<br />
<br />
ALWAYS make sure the  `#end of finder/start of info` is not moved around the config, this will completely break it.
